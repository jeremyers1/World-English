Making English easier to spell and read

## Goal: To help English become the trade language of the world. 

## How: By making English easier to learn, spell, and read. 


1. Clarify the alphabet. 
	Each letter should have one sound and one sound only. A few additional letters will be 	needed to make this happen. 

2. Exterminate phonics. 
	With the addition of a few letters to the alphabet, the need for phonics is eliminated.

3. Remove spelling exceptions. 
	There are no more complicated rules to remember which always have exceptions anyway. 

4. Reduce reading rules. 
	There are only two rules now, which are found below. 
	1. Each letter has one sound. 
	2. Read the letters in order to form words.
